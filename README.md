# AImpact: My Journey to Becoming a World-Class AI Engineer

*‚ÄúTransforming curiosity into cutting-edge AI solutions, one day at a time.‚Äù*

## üöÄ About This Repository
Welcome to **AImpact**, my daily chronicle of mastering Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. As a Computer Science graduate (GPA 3.99, Binus University) with 5 Scopus/IEEE publications, Apple Developer Academy internship experience, and a passion for AI, I‚Äôm on a mission to become a world-class AI Engineer. This repository documents my consistent progress‚Äîcoding, math, problem-solving, and more‚Äîstarting from **May 13, 2025**, with the goal of landing a high-impact career in AI (Big Tech, startups) and securing a fully funded MS/PhD at top universities.

Each day, I push code, notes, and insights, building a robust foundation in Python, ML, deep learning, and MLOps while preparing for global opportunities. Whether you're an HRD, recruiter, or fellow learner, explore my journey and witness my growth!

## üéØ Goals
- **Short-Term (3 Months)**: Master Python, linear algebra, and ML fundamentals; publish a Kaggle notebook; solve 100 LeetCode problems.
- **Mid-Term (6 Months)**: Build end-to-end AI projects (computer vision, NLP); deploy models on AWS.
- **Long-Term (1 Year)**: Secure an AI Engineer role in Singapore/US/UK/Australia; earn a fully funded MS/PhD scholarship.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, Swift (iOS)
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow (coming soon)
- **Tools**: Git, VS Code, XCode, Colab, AWS (planned)
- **Platforms**: Kaggle, LeetCode, GitHub

## üåü Why This Matters
- **Consistency**: Daily commits showcase my discipline and growth mindset.
- **Relevance**: Focused on AI skills (Python, ML, MLOps) demanded by Big Tech (Apple, Google, Meta) and startups (Grab, Shopee).
- **Impact**: Building toward real-world AI projects (e.g., pose detection iOS app, Kaggle competitions).
- **Global Aspiration**: Preparing for MS/PhD at top universities (NTU, MIT) and a career in Singapore/US.
